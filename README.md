# FuseIgnite

This is the working repository for the Fuse:Ignite application. A Networking application for Events and Conferences.

It uses iBeacons and local location technology to triangulate users position and relevancy in order to connect them to the most relevant users talks and exhibitions at the conference or event they are attending.

Currently this project does not use Cocoa Pods. I have worked round this at the moment by providing a Frameworks compressed file which needs to be added to the project on a fresh install. Add to root directory, then add to xcode. All paths exist in build settings to allow the project to find this.
